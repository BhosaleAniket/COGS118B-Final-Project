# Final Project for Group 47

This project aims to explore the application of Spectral Clustering methods to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

To achieve the aforementioned problem, we created a model architecture that combined both unsupervised and supervised learning strategies.

The unsupervised stage consists of spectral clustering pre-processing combined with a feature transformation. 

The supervised stage consists of a SVM classifier trained with a RBF kernel.
